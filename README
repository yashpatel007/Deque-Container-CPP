Not Working: 
	1. the sort function is not implemented and i have commented it out. Everything else is working fine!
	
Implementation: 
	The Deque work on the principal of circular array which can be expanded on need. 
	With the help of circular array the performance for both insersion at front as well as back is approx 
	O(1)[with some extra overhead maybe].
	
	               	    CIRCULAR QUEUE
